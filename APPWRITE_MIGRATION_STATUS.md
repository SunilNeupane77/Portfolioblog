# Appwrite Migration Status Report

## Completed Changes

1. **Configuration**:
   - ✅ Set up Appwrite endpoint: `https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1`
   - ✅ Configured Appwrite Project ID: `6835b3bd0035060dca06`
   - ✅ Configured Appwrite Database ID: `6836ce9a00348a0eda84`
   - ✅ Configured Appwrite Blog Collection ID: `6836cee2001ae4e8dd46`
   - ✅ Configured Appwrite Blog Bucket ID: `6836cf84000124334ac5`

2. **File Changes**:
   - ✅ Created Appwrite configuration file (`src/lib/appwrite.ts`)
   - ✅ Updated authentication hook to use Appwrite (`src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated blog post creation page (`src/app/dashboard/blog/new/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated blog post list page (`src/app/(main)/blog/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated blog post detail page (`src/app/(main)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated dashboard blog management page (`src/app/dashboard/blog/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated dashboard layout (`src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated navigation bar (`src/components/layout/navbar.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated Next.js config for Appwrite image domains (`next.config.ts`)
   - ✅ Removed old Firebase auth hook file (`src/hooks/use-auth.ts`)

## Remaining Issues

1. **Blog Edit Page**:
   - ⚠️ The blog edit page (`src/app/dashboard/blog/edit/[id]/page.tsx`) has syntax errors in the `onSubmit` function
   - **Solution**: The complete file needs to be rewritten to fix the structure

2. **User Profile Display**:
   - ℹ️ Firebase uses `user.displayName` but Appwrite uses `user.name` - all occurrences have been updated

3. **CSS Warning**:
   - ⚠️ There's a warning about inline CSS styles in the blog edit page
   - **Solution**: This is a lint warning and doesn't affect functionality

4. **Appwrite Schema Setup**:
   - ℹ️ Ensure your Appwrite database collection has all required fields (title, content, slug, imageUrl, etc.)

## Testing Steps

1. Test user authentication (login/logout)
2. Test blog post creation with image upload
3. Test blog post listing and filtering
4. Test blog post editing (may have issues due to remaining syntax errors)
5. Test blog post viewing on the main site

## Recommendations

1. Complete the fixes for the blog edit page by rewriting the onSubmit function
2. Review and update the permissions in your Appwrite console
3. Consider running a data migration if you have existing blog posts in Firebase
4. Update your README to reflect the change from Firebase to Appwrite
