# Appwrite Migration Status Report

## Completed Changes

1. **Configuration**:
   - ✅ Set up Appwrite endpoint: `https://fra.cloud.appwrite.io/v1`
   - ✅ Configured Appwrite Project ID: `6835b3bd0035060dca06`
   - ✅ Configured Appwrite Database ID: `6836ce9a00348a0eda84`
   - ✅ Configured Appwrite Blog Collection ID: `6836cee2001ae4e8dd46`
   - ✅ Configured Appwrite Blog Bucket ID: `6836cf84000124334ac5`

2. **File Changes**:
   - ✅ Created Appwrite configuration file (`src/lib/appwrite.ts`)
   - ✅ Updated authentication hook to use Appwrite (`src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated blog post creation page (`src/app/dashboard/blog/new/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated blog post list page (`src/app/(main)/blog/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated blog post detail page (`src/app/(main)/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated dashboard blog management page (`src/app/dashboard/blog/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated dashboard layout (`src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated navigation bar (`src/components/layout/navbar.tsx`)
   - ✅ Updated Next.js config for Appwrite image domains (`next.config.ts`)
   - ✅ Removed old Firebase auth hook file (`src/hooks/use-auth.ts`)

## Remaining Issues

1. **Authentication fixes**:
   - ✅ Fixed React hooks violation in login page by properly storing `useAuth()` at component level
   - ✅ Updated authentication methods to match Appwrite SDK (`createEmailPasswordSession` instead of `createEmailSession`)

2. **User Profile Display**:
   - ℹ️ Firebase uses `user.displayName` but Appwrite uses `user.name` - all occurrences have been updated

3. **UI Components**:
   - ✅ Created and integrated a reusable `ProgressBar` component to replace inline styles
   - ✅ Updated both new post and edit post pages to use the ProgressBar component

4. **Appwrite Schema Setup**:
   - ℹ️ Ensure your Appwrite database collection has all required fields (title, content, slug, imageUrl, etc.)

## Testing Steps

1. Test user authentication (login/logout)
2. Test blog post creation with image upload
3. Test blog post listing and filtering
4. Test blog post editing (may have issues due to remaining syntax errors)
5. Test blog post viewing on the main site

## Recommendations

1. Review and update the permissions in your Appwrite console
2. Consider running a data migration if you have existing blog posts in Firebase
3. Update your README to reflect the change from Firebase to Appwrite
4. Update any deployment scripts or CI/CD pipelines to include the new Appwrite environment variables
